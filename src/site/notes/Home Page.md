**Attica** is a city-state of resistance, endurance and defiance. Defiance against all odds. It has not just survived, but rebelled against, and thrived in the face of terrors both cataclysmic and man-made. Wars, earthquakes, floods, sinking bedrock, rising sea levels couldn't snuff out its spirit. 

It's a city of steel and chrome that rises out of the *Sea of Brass* below it like an obelisk, a beacon of opportunity. The city's skeleton is a labyrinthine network of canals and bridges that can be traversed using barges and gondolas. Small canals and winding water sources separate communities, and alleys spin out in chaotic directions as the metropolis keeps stretching its boundaries and growing in size.

Attica's ..._unique_ government ensures that the lights stay on, buildings remain dry, the water stays clean, and the streets are kept in good repair. Law as other places know it, does not exist here. Instead the city is governed by the ten syndicates who signed the Amity Pact (T.A.P. for short). This magical contract keeps the peace by forbidding one syndicate to encroach and fight another, leaving the city in a perpetual state of cold war.
